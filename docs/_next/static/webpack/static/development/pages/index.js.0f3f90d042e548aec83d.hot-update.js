One of very few engineers to have the opportunity to learn in such a professional studio environment, his career developed working on a huge variety of styles and genres - from late night hiphop sessions to live band tracking sessions in the Beatles room to classical and film score recordings in the reverberant Studio 1. Toby\u2019s burgeoning passion for analogue recording developed through work in London and Nashville and has led to a hybrid approach, combining the best of digital software with the character of analogue equipment to best suit the music. A life-long lover of music and experimentation - Toby\u2019s sessions have a relaxed atmosphere so to enable artists to be their most creative."), __jsx(_index_style__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__["AboutText"], {

During an inspiring time in Nashville he engineered many memorable sessions with Cobb including work with Barry Gibb, Dawes, The Highwomen, Jason Isbell, Dolly Parton, Brandi Carlile, Chris Stapleton, Dirty Heads, Keith Urban and Anderson East. Much of the time at RCA Studio A was recording bands playing together live, with Dave Cobb often producing from the studio floor, recording to tape - more akin to a 60s and 70s recording style not so often seen these days."), __jsx(_index_style__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__["AboutText"], {
