Toby’s burgeoning passion for\n        analogue recording developed through work in London and Nashville and\n        has led to a hybrid approach, combining the best of digital software\n        with the character of analogue equipment to best suit the music. A\n        life-long lover of music and experimentation - Toby’s sessions have a\n        relaxed atmosphere so to enable artists to be their most creative.\n      </AboutText>\n\n      <AboutText>\n        In 2019, Toby left Abbey Road and followed the music when he was offered\n        the chance to move to Nashville to work as engineer for multi-Grammy\n        winning record producer Dave Cobb at Historic RCA Studio A. During an\n        inspiring time in Nashville he engineered many memorable sessions with\n        Cobb including work with Barry Gibb, Dawes, The Highwomen, Jason Isbell,\n        Dolly Parton, Brandi Carlile, Chris Stapleton, Dirty Heads, Keith Urban\n        and Anderson East. Much of the time at RCA Studio A was recording bands\n        playing together live, with Dave Cobb often producing from the studio\n        floor, recording to tape - more akin to a 60s and 70s recording style\n        not so often seen these days.\n      </AboutText>\n\n      <AboutText>\n        His varied music work at Abbey Road included sessions with artists such\n        as Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Frank Ocean, Kasabian, and as part of\n        Abbey Road’s live sessions he worked with artists including Alabama\n        Shakes and Mumford & Sons.\n      </AboutText>\n\n      <AboutText>\n        Toby also has extensive film scoring experience, initially as a score\n        recordist on titles such as the Oscar winning Gravity, The Imitation\n        Game, Suffragette, The Avengers and The Martian and more recently as\n        scoring engineer and score mixer. Recent TV and film work includes\n        engineering on Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis film and mixing for UK based\n        composers Paul Englishby and Carly Paradis.\n      </AboutText>\n\n      <AboutText>\n        Toby now works out of his own room at Urchin Studios, London as a\n        freelance engineer, mixer and producer on music and film productions.\n        With a window through to the Urchin live space - Toby is setup to record\n        band and overdub sessions directly from his control room.\n      </AboutText>\n    </Stack>\n  </HomeSection>\n);\n\nexport { ThisAbout as About };\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAiBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAaA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAxDA;AACA;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
