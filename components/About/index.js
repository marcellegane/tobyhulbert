        In an era of laptop producers where everyone and their dog is an
        engineer, Toby is a rare breed. Coming up in-house at Abbey Road - where
        he spent 7 years locked in the studio and immersing himself in Abbey
        Road’s rich recording history - he’s one of very few engineers to have
        the chance to learn in such a professional studio environment, and to
        develop working on a such a variety of styles and genres. He’s had the
        chance to work with artists such as Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Oh
        Wonder, Frank Ocean, Dirty Heads, Kasabian and Dawes. And being a part
        of Abbey Road’s live sessions he had the opportunity to record Alabama
        Shakes, Mumford & Sons, Izzy Bizu & Jack Garratt.

        During his time at Abbey Road he worked with some of the world’s most
        imminent producers - engineering for legends such as Tony Visconti, Alan
        Parsons and Nile Rodgers to the younger generation Malay and Om’Mas
        Keith. He also worked closely with many of the top Hollywood film
        scoring engineers such as Peter Cobbin, Simon Rhodes, Dennis Sands and
        Sam Okell.

        Toby’s progression continued in 2019 when he moved to RCA Studio A -
        Nashville, TN to work alongside six-time Grammy winning record producer
        Dave Cobb, in search of the opportunity to make more records. Realising
        that you never stop learning he’s now focused on continuing to learn
        from the Southern American recording styles and whenever possible enjoys
        creating natural recordings to tape with musicians playing live in the
        room together.

        Although his skills were developed in the digital era, Toby has studied
        many analogue recording techniques while working across studios in
        London and Nashville. He uses a hybrid approach, combining the best of
        digital software with the character of analogue equipment, but adapts
        his approach in order to service whatever the music. Toby brings a great
        enthusiasm for music and experimentation to his sessions and aims to
        create a relaxed atmosphere where artists can be creative.

        Toby’s also gained great experience in soundtrack recording and
        production, working as score recordist on titles such as the Oscar
        winning Gravity, The Imitation Game, Suffragette (on which he was also
        score editor), and The Avengers. During the summer of 2015 he enjoyed a
        month working as digital scoring engineer for Ridley Scott's The
        Martian, as well as engineering solo sessions for Hacksaw Ridge. He’s
        recently recorded and mixed scores for Natalie Holt including the Royal
        Television Society nominated score for BBC’s hard-hitting drama Three
        Girls, BBC’s The Boy with the Topknot and the feature film Journey’s
        End.
