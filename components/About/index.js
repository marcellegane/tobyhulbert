        After graduating from University of Surrey’s Tonmeister course, Toby
        made his way up the ranks in-house at Abbey Road where he spent seven
        years immersing himself in the studio’s rich recording history and
        working with some of the world’s most imminent producers and engineers.
        One of very few engineers to have the opportunity to learn in such a
        professional studio environment, his career developed working on a huge
        variety of styles and genres - from late night hiphop sessions to live
        band tracking sessions in the Beatles room to classical and film score
        recordings in the reverberant Studio 1. Toby’s burgeoning passion for
        analogue recording developed through work in London and Nashville and
        has led to a hybrid approach, combining the best of digital software
        with the character of analogue equipment to best suit the music. A
        life-long lover of music and experimentation - Toby’s sessions have a
        relaxed atmosphere so to enable artists to be their most creative.

        In 2019, Toby left Abbey Road and followed the music when he was offered
        the chance to move to Nashville to work as engineer for multi-Grammy
        winning record producer Dave Cobb at Historic RCA Studio A. During an
        inspiring time in Nashville he engineered many memorable sessions with
        Cobb including work with Barry Gibb, Dawes, The Highwomen, Jason Isbell,
        Dolly Parton, Brandi Carlile, Chris Stapleton, Dirty Heads, Keith Urban
        and Anderson East. Much of the time at RCA Studio A was recording bands
        playing together live, with Dave Cobb often producing from the studio
        floor, recording to tape - more akin to a 60s and 70s recording style
        not so often seen these days.

        His varied music work at Abbey Road included sessions with artists such
        as Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Frank Ocean, Kasabian, and as part of
        Abbey Road’s live sessions he worked with artists including Alabama
        Shakes and Mumford & Sons.

        scoring engineer and score mixer. Recent TV and film work includes
